<h1 style="text-align: center;">Matrix Product Toolkit</h1>
<h2>1. Spin 1/2 Heisenberg chain</h2>
The first step is to construct a lattice, and the associated
operators.&nbsp; All operators that are used for a particular lattice
are stored in one file, and indexed by name.&nbsp; This includes all
operators that are
defined by the site basis, named as
"Operator(coordinates)", the identity operator "I" and the Hamiltonian
"H".&nbsp; For example, "Sz(5)" is the operator
that measures the z-component of the spin at coordinate 5.<br>
<br>
There is a program to generate the lattice and operators for a
one-dimensional isotropic nearest neighbor spin chain with open
boundary conditions,
named <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-spinchain</span>.&nbsp; <br>
<pre>Usage: mp-spinchain &lt;L&gt; &lt;EdgeSpin&gt; &lt;BulkSpin&gt; &lt;J&gt; &lt;J2&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;<br></pre>
Here, <span style="font-weight: bold;">L</span> is the number of
lattice sites.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">EdgeSpin</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">BulkSpin</span> specify the
magnitude of the spins at the left/right boundaries and in the bulk,
respectively.&nbsp; The EdgeSpin is mostly useful to reduce edge
effects in
integer spin chains.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">J</span>
is the strength of the bilinear coupling <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">S(i) S(i+1)</span>, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">J2</span> is the strength of the
biquadratic coupling <span style="font-weight: bold;">(S(i) S(i+1))<sup>2</sup></span>.&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold;">outfile</span> is the name of the file
that will store the lattice and Hamiltonian description.<br>
<br>
To generate a Hamiltonian for a 60 site spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, use<br>
<pre>mp-spinchain 60 0.5 0.5 1 0 spinhalf-60<br></pre>
This will take a few seconds.&nbsp; Once this is complete, we can see
the dimensions of each symmetry sector of the Hilbert space, using the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mp-dimensions</span> program.<br>
<br>
<pre>mp-dimensions spinhalf-60<br></pre>
You might need to scroll up the terminal, or pipe the output through <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">'more'</span> to see all of the output,
especially for a long chain.&nbsp; The most interesting symmetry sector
is Sz=0, which is also the largest.&nbsp; How does the dimension of
this sector compare to what could be done with exact
diagonalization?&nbsp; How much would additional symmetries (eg, spin
reflection or translation symmetry) help?<br>
<br>
Using the lattice description, we can generate some matrix product
states.&nbsp; Firstly, we will construct the N&eacute;el state.&nbsp;
The program <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-construct</span> is
used to construct <span style="font-style: italic;">m=1</span> matrix
product states.&nbsp;
These simply correspond to basis states of the original lattice,
specified by a list of basis states, one for each lattice site.&nbsp;
Thus, the Ne&eacute;l state, which looks like<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 361px; height: 39px;" alt="Neel state" src="neel.jpg"><br>
<br>
can be constructed by specifying an input list of basis states, one
state on each line.&nbsp; These&nbsp; are specified from right to left,
thus to
reproduce the N&eacute;el state with a down-spin on the left hand edge
and an
up-spin on the right hand edge we need a file that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">starts </span>with 0.5 and&nbsp;<span
 style="font-style: italic;">ends </span>with -0.5;<br>
<br>

<br>
Use your favourite editor to construct this, or simply cut&amp;paste
from this page (<span style="font-style: italic;">three times</span>,
since
this only includes 20 lines and you need 60).&nbsp; Save this text file
as <span style="font-weight: bold;">neel-in</span>.&nbsp; If you have
fewer basis states than exist in the physical lattice, the program will
fail.&nbsp; Extra lines are ignored.<br>
<br>
To generate the matrix product representation of the N&eacute;el state,
use<br>
<pre>mp-construct spinhalf-60 neel-in neel-state<br></pre>
This command takes the lattice we defined before (<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">spinhalf-60</span>), the description of the
basis state (<span style="font-weight: bold;">neel-in</span>), and
saves the matrix product wavefunction as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">neel-state</span>.<br>
<br>
With any matrix product wavefunction, we can calculate
expectation values, overlaps and so on.&nbsp; A rather trivial example
is,<br>
<pre>mp-overlap neel-state neel-state</pre>
which should give '1', since the state is normalized.&nbsp; Note that
the lattice description is not needed to calculate overlaps between
wavefunctions.&nbsp; Almost as trivial, <br>
<pre>mp-expectation spinhalf-60 neel-state 'Sz(1)' neel-state<br></pre>
calculates the expectation value <span style="font-weight: bold;">&lt;neel-state
| Sz(1) | neel-state&gt;</span>, the z-component of the first spin on
the lattice, which, all being well, will be -0.5.&nbsp; The quotes ('
or ") are
needed to stop the shell from interpreting the '(' itself.&nbsp; We can
also calculate a correlation function;<br>
<pre>mp-correlation spinhalf-60 neel-state Sz 5 Sz 15<br></pre>
which calculates the expectation value of the operator 'Sz(5) * Sz(j)',
for j = 5,6,...,15.&nbsp; (mp-expectation does not yet understand
expressions, otherwise you could enter an expression like 'Sz(5) *
Sz(6)' into <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-expectation</span>
directly).<br>
<br>
We can also
calculate the expectation value of the energy for this state;<br>
<pre>mp-expectation spinhalf-60 neel-state H neel-state<br></pre>
which will be exactly (-0.25) * 59 = -14.75.<br>
<br>
We still have some work to do
before we get to the ground state.&nbsp; We can, in principle, use any
state as an initial state for an eigensolver, but a truely
random state always works better.&nbsp; Lets generate one:<br>
<pre>mp-random spinhalf-60 0 10 random-state<br></pre>
This will use our lattice <span style="font-weight: bold;">(spinhalf-60)</span>
to generate a random state with quantum number Sz=0 that is a
superposition of 10 basis vectors, and save the resulting wavefunction
as <span style="font-weight: bold;">random-state</span>.&nbsp; If you
want, you can verify that this state is normalized using the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mp-overlap</span> function.&nbsp; You can
also calculate the overlap with our N&eacute;el state, or an
expectation
value, in the same way that we did before.&nbsp; The chances of the
overlap being non-zero however, are very small (Homework question:
exactly how small do you expect <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-overlap
neel-state random-state</span> to be?).&nbsp; [NOTE: currently, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mp-random</span> does nothing special to
initialize the random seed.&nbsp; So, if you enter the same parameters
twice, you are likely to get exactly the same 'random' state out.]<br>
<br>
To see some information about our random state, try<br>
<pre>mp-info random-state | more<br></pre>
This will show the reduced density matrix eigenvalues for every
possible partition, from left to right.&nbsp; The eigenvalues are the
square of the wavefunction amplitudes of the Schmidt factorization, or,
equivalently, the square of the singular values of the singular value
decomposition.&nbsp; The number of eigenvalues is the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">m</span> parameter familiar from
DMRG.&nbsp; The 'Quantum Number' column here is the the quantum number
(in this case, the z-component of the spin) of the basis state in the
right partition.&nbsp; (what does this imply about
the quantum numbers of the <span style="font-style: italic;">left</span>
partition?)&nbsp; If the wavefunction contains a lot of states but you
only
want to see information for a few of them, you can supply a second
argument which is the maximum number of eigenvalues to show.<br>
<br>
We now have a lot of options to start evolving this state to the ground
state.&nbsp; So we can compare different methods, make a copy of the
wavefunction, as 'state1'<br>
<pre>cp random-state state1</pre>
Firstly, we will do a truncated Lanczos diagonalization starting from
the
random state.&nbsp; This is done with the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mp-lanczos</span> command.&nbsp; The usage
is<br>
<pre>usage: mp-lanczos &lt;lattice&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;wavefunction&gt; &lt;iterations&gt; [&lt;max-states&gt;]<br></pre>
Generallly, the operator will be the Hamiltonian, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">H</span>.&nbsp; The wavefunction is the
initial 'guess' vector, the iterations is the number of Lanczos steps
to perform, and max-states is the maximum number of states to keep (the
parameter <span style="font-style: italic;">m</span>, from
DMRG).&nbsp; If you don't specify max-states, it is taken to be
infinite.&nbsp; The calculation then becomes equivalent to an exact
diagonalization, so don't expect it to converge quickly for a large
lattice!&nbsp; In our case, we want to do a simple diagonalization
starting from a copy of our random state, so try<br>
<pre>mp-lanczos spinhalf-60 H state1 10 50<br></pre>
For each iteration, the output is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">a</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">b<sup>2</sup></span> matrix
elements of the
tri-diagonal form of the Hamiltonian, the estimated energy, the
squared-norm of the added Krylov vector, and the normalized overlap
between the added Krylov vector and the initial guess vector.&nbsp; In
principle the overlap should be zero, but numerical loss of
orthogonality is inevitable in any Lanczos calculation and typically
occurs at the point where the energy has reached convergence.&nbsp; If
you play around with the number of states, you will see that the
truncation has a severe effect on this overlap and it typically becomes
large even when the energy is a long way from convergence.&nbsp; The
reason for this is that the truncation operator does not commute with
the Hamiltonian, so the only way to get a robust algorithm would be to
explicitly re-orthogonalize at every step.&nbsp; This is not yet
implemented, so instead you will need to limit the number of iterations
(depending on the number of states kept, a dozen or so might be OK),
and 'restart' the diagonalization.&nbsp; At the
end of the specified number of iterations, you will see the full set of
Lanczos eigenvalues, and the program will calculate the Lanczos vector
and save it back to the wavefunction file.<br>
<br>
NOTE: the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-lanczos</span> program uses the
wavefunction file as temporary work space during the calculation.&nbsp;
This means that if you interrupt the caclulation before it is complete,
or the program fails for some reason, the wavefunction file will almost
certainly be corrupted.&nbsp; If you
want to avoid this, make a copy of the wavefunction before you run <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mp-lanczos</span>.&nbsp; This applies for
most of the other <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp</span> tools too.<br>
<br>
Repeat the mp-lanczos calculation a few times until you get
bored.&nbsp; If you really want to get close to the groundstate, you
will probably need to restart the Lanczos a dozen or so times, and keep
in mind that 50 states is very small by DMRG standards.&nbsp; But don't
waste time on this, later we will do the same calculation with DMRG,
which will get to the groundstate much faster.<br>
<br>
Now we can calculate some interesting physics.&nbsp; Firstly, some
correlation functions.&nbsp; Try<br>
<pre>mp-correlation spinhalf-60 state1 Sz 10 Sz 30<br></pre>
You should see decaying antiferromagnetic
correlations.&nbsp; Now, try calculating the overlap between our ground
state and the N&eacute;el state.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Now we will try some DMRG.&nbsp; The 'traditional' approach to DMRG is
to have two 'bare' sites at the lattice partition, and this is probably
the most robust.&nbsp; This program is called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mp-dmrg-2site</span>.&nbsp; <br>
<pre>usage: mp-dmrg-2site &lt;lattice&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;psi&gt; [lanczos-iter] [&lt;maxstates&gt;]</pre>
This program also uses Lanczos, but in a completely different way to
the <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-lanczos</span> program; here
it is used as the superblock eigensolver [the Davidson algorithm is
often used in DMRG, but Lanczos is almost as good in this
application].&nbsp; In DMRG, there is a tradeoff with the accuracy of
the superblock diagonalization, versus the number of sweeps.&nbsp; In
general, it is better to spend less time diagonalizing the superblock,
and instead do extra sweeps.&nbsp; This can help avoid getting stuck in
a local minima, but too few Lanczos iterations will fail to
converge.&nbsp;
10 is conservative choice that should work well in most cases.<br>
<br>
Firstly, make another copy of the random state,<br>
<pre>cp random-state state2</pre>
and then try a dmrg sweep:<br>
<pre>mp-dmrg-2site spinhalf-60 H state2 2 50</pre>
This performs one complete DMRG sweep (moving the partition all the way
to the right, and then back to the left), outputting the location of
the partition, the energy, and the number of non-zero density matrix
eigenvalues (the <span style="font-style: italic;">Schmidt number</span>).&nbsp;
Our initial state has only <span style="font-style: italic;">m=10</span>
states, for which 2 Lanczos iterations works fine.&nbsp; We keep a
maximum of 50 states, which probably won't be reached on the first
sweep.&nbsp; One DMRG sweep takes a comparable amount of time to a
single iteration using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-lanczos</span>
program, but notice the rate of convergence!<br>
<br>
Do one more sweep, this time increasing the number of Lanczos
iterations to 10.&nbsp; This should give you the ground state energy to
about 0.01%.&nbsp; One more sweep and the energy will be converged for
this number of basis states.&nbsp; To get an estimate of how accurate
the energy is, increase the number of states to 100, and then to
200.&nbsp; You may need to do two sweeps to get complete
convergence.&nbsp; Notice that the number of basis states never
actually reaches 200 - the calculation is essentially exact.&nbsp; Use <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mp-info</span> to
have a look at the truncation error.&nbsp; [Question: sometimes the
truncation error is a small <span style="font-style: italic;">negative</span>
number.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Another question: Do you notice any pattern in
the density matrix eigenvalues?&nbsp; What causes this?&nbsp; (Hint:
look at the quantum numbers too!)]<br>
<br>
What is the overlap between the groundstate obtained from <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mp-lanczos</span> versus the DMRG
groundstate?&nbsp; What is the overlap with the Neel state?<br>
<br>
A variant on DMRG is to only have a single 'bare site'.&nbsp; This
algorithm has rather different properties; the 'truncation error' is
identically zero, so the energy decreases assymptotically (rather than
'traditional' DMRG, where the energy typically oscillates within some
small interval).&nbsp; It is also not possible to increase the number
of basis states with this algorithm.&nbsp; If you try single-site DMRG
from the <span style="font-style: italic;">m=10</span> random state,
it will most likely fail.&nbsp; While it runs a bit faster than
two-site DMRG it also converges somewhat slower, making it not so
useful except in the final stages of a calculation where the
zero-truncation-error property is desirable for calculating observables
[Question: Why?].&nbsp; This program is called <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mp-dmrg</span>, and has the same parameters
for <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-dmrg-2site</span>.&nbsp; An
interesting approach is to mix single-site DMRG with an iteration or
two of the power method (with <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-apply</span>
followed by <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-normalize</span>), 1st
order imaginary time evolution (with <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-itime</span>),
or matrix-product Lanczos using <span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-lanczos</span>.<br>
<br>
<h2>2.&nbsp; Spin 1 Heisenberg Chain</h2>
The spin-1 antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin chain has a VBS
groundstate, where an open boundary or impurity traps an effective
spin-1/2 particle.&nbsp; To partially compensate for this, we can
indroduce real spin-1/2 states at the boundary.&nbsp; The prototypical
VBS state is the AKLT state, which is solved exactly with DMRG.&nbsp;
The AKLT Hamiltonian has a biquadratic interaction of strength
1/3.&nbsp; To generate this for a 40 site lattice (you could also try
60 sites, but it will take a little longer to converge), use<br>
<pre>mp-spinchain 40 0.5 1 1 0.3333333333 spin1-40-aklt</pre>
To generate an initial state with Schmidt number <span
 style="font-style: italic;">m=10</span>, named <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">akltstate,</span> use<br>
<pre>mp-random spin1-40-aklt 0 10 akltstate</pre>
and evolve it towards the groundstate with<br>
<pre>mp-dmrg-2site spin1-40-aklt H akltstate 4 10</pre>
Repeat this command until the energy converges.&nbsp; What happens to
the Schmidt number?&nbsp; use '<span style="font-weight: bold;">mp-info
akltstate</span>' to see what is happening.&nbsp; The two-fold spin
degeneracy is removed by using <span style="font-style: italic;">SU(2)</span>
symmetry, which reduces the Schmidt number to <span
 style="font-style: italic;">m=1</span>, and makes it possible to
construct the AKLT state using the mp-construct program, as we did
earlier for the Neel state.&nbsp; This will be possible in the final
version of this program.&nbsp; [Harder questions: why isn't the energy <span
 style="font-style: italic;">exactly</span> -26.0 ?&nbsp; What is the
limit here on the precision?&nbsp; Is this avoidable?]<br>
<br>
Calculate the spin-spin correlation function of this state, with<br>
<pre>mp-correlation spin1-40-aklt akltstate Sz 2 Sz 20</pre>
What is the correlation length?<br>
<br>
There is a program to calculate the 'string' correlation
function.&nbsp; This inserts an operator (-1)<sup>Sz</sup>, of the
total z-spin between the left and right sites of the correlation
function.&nbsp; Run this with<br>
<pre>mp-stringcorrelation spin1-40-aklt akltstate Sz 2 Sz 20</pre>
What is the difference compared with the two-point correlator?<br>
<br>
<br>
Repeat the calculation for the pure Heisenberg model with no
biquadratic interaction.&nbsp; You will need to keep more than 10
states to get a good groundstate!&nbsp; What happens to the two-point
and string correlation functions?&nbsp; What is the overlap between the
pure Heisenberg groundstate and the AKLT state?<br>
<br>
If you construct an initial state with Sz=1 rather than Sz=0, you can
calculate the Haldane gap.&nbsp; Note however that the gap is somewhat
renormalized by the open boundary conditions.&nbsp; This can be
minimized by adusting the interaction strength at the boundaries, to
smooth out the spin density fluctuations from the open boundary
conditions.&nbsp; But you cannot specify such couplings separately, yet.<br>
