complexify block-operator

mpstate: generalize operator_prod(SimpleOperator, MPStateComponent, MPStateComponent) to
cases where the SimpleOperator is not scalar.  This is a special case of operator_prod where the
initial E matrix is identity.

pheap:
multiple heaps / import a heap without copy

quantumnumbers:
clean up the implementation of quantum numbers, with a small-string optimization.  Or possibly
an integer lookup table?
