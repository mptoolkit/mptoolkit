The use of MPS for non-equilibrium 
systems has a long history, dealing mostly with steady states of ASEP models,
dating back to at least Derrida et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 26, 1493 (1993)
and has a rich history since then (see for example arXiv:0706.1678), apparently
with very little intersecting with either the DMRG or QI literature.
