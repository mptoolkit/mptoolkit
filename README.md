# Matrix Product Toolkit

This is the Github repository for the Matrix Product Toolkit.

The Matrix Product Toolkit is a project which started life around 2002, originally envisaged as a ‘next generation’ DMRG code, incorporating non-abelian symmetries and with an emphasis on a flexible and generic way to construct Hamiltonian operators and measure observables.  It has been used in over 100 research publications.

Documentation for the toolkit is available from https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/IanMcCulloch/mptoolkit/index.php?n=Main.HomePage
